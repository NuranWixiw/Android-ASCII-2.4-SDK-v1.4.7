Upgrading to Gradle 4.4
-----------------------

If you wish to use Gradle 4.4 and Android Gradle plugin 3.1.2 then the build tools will need to be updated as indicated when syncing (27.0.3 at the time of writing).
You will also need to search and replace 'instrumentTest' with 'androidTest'

Other warnings, such as "Configuration 'compile' is obsolete ", will be addressed in a future release.
